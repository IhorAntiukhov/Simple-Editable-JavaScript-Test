## Simple Editable JavaScript Test

This project is an example of how you can make *a simple test on JavaScript*. In your test, you can add *questions with one correct answer*, *multiple correct answers*, or questions in which you must *enter the answer in the input* field. In my test you can also set a *time limit*.

I added the ability to *change test questions without changing the JS* code. You can change the names of the questions, choose the correct answers and change the time to solve the test.

*You can also add new questions* with one or more correct answers or questions with an input field.
